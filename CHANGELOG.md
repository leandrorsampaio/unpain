# Changelog

This file documents all notable changes to UnPAIN.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). UnPAIN aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **An Overview page across every year on record, and the app now opens on it.** Four figures
  (income, expenses, savings, savings rate), liquid net worth over every month, income vs expenses
  by month, and where the money goes. Reachable any time from the home icon beside the year
  selector — it sits there rather than in the tab row because it is the one page the year selector
  does not apply to. The figures are the same `year_summary` the Dashboard shows, added up: widening
  the window must not change what a euro means. Year costs can be spread across the months of the
  year they belong to, never across another year's, using the same switch and the same caveat as the
  Dashboard. A second "where the money goes" breaks the same total down by **subcategory**: the 15
  biggest are named and everything smaller is collapsed into one Other slice, because thirty named
  slivers is a legend, not a chart. Subcategories inherit their category's colour, so each one steps
  along a light-to-dark ramp inside its family — the grouping still reads and the slices stay apart.

- **Settings › Balances**: a year grid of recorded account balances — months down, accounts across, with
  a per-month total. Each cell is either a balance recorded from a statement (carrying its reconciliation
  verdict) or the figure the ledger computes, shown so you can check it against your bank. Entry is a
  per-account-year dialog: type a balance, press Enter, move to the next month. Correcting a recorded
  figure now needs an explicit `replace` (`POST /api/anchor`), so a contradiction still conflicts by default.
- **Bulk actions ask before they write.** The confirmation lists the fields it is about to change,
  built from the same object that gets sent, and lives inside `bulkRun` so a bulk action added later
  cannot skip it.
- **Year costs can be spread across the months** in the dashboard's income-vs-expenses chart, with a
  switch that defaults on. Without it the twelve months summed to less than the year totals printed
  above them and nothing said so. The caption always names which of the two views is on screen, and the
  divisor is the months that have happened, so a running year is not amortized into its own future.

### Changed

- The dashboard net-worth chart shows the selected year only (January to December) instead of the whole
  history, and is renamed **Liquid net worth** — it charts recorded account balances, not total wealth.
  Outside the running year the heading reads "End of &lt;year&gt;" rather than "Now".
- **Writes confirm themselves with a toast.** `showMessage` was a modal with an OK button, so every
  saved edit cost a click; it is now a transient message in the corner. Confirmation moved into `api()`
  — every POST reports — so feedback no longer depends on which screen you are on. Errors stay up
  longer and keep a close button.
- Settings spans the full app width like every other page. Content keeps a readable measure; sections
  holding a data grid opt out of it.

### Fixed

- The app shell stamps its own asset versions from each file's mtime and size, instead of hand-written
  `?v=` strings in `index.html`. A forgotten bump shipped new JS with the previously cached stylesheet,
  which looks exactly like a broken page.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Initial public release. UnPAIN is a self-hosted, offline-first expense tracker for two-person
  households:
  - Bank CSV ingestion with format auto-detection (`pipeline/formats/*.json`), content-hash dedupe,
    and ECB foreign-currency conversion. Deterministic PDF extraction for PDF-only sources, gated by
    balance reconciliation.
  - Learned merchant-categorization rules (family- and per-person-scoped), applied on read. UnPAIN
    recomputes everything derived (dashboards, settlement, tax) and never stores it.
  - Income-proportional settlement between partners, with a monthly estimate and a binding annual
    true-up. Recurring-payment detection. A year-end German tax evidence pack.
  - FastAPI and vanilla-JS Material Design 3 web UI (English and German), fully offline. Optional
    LLM skills at the edges (categorization proposals, statement extraction) — no API keys, no
    vendor lock-in.
  - Try it with `./start.sh --demo` (synthetic data in an isolated `./demo/`).
